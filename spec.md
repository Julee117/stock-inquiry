# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - I created a gem which prompts the user to input a valid stock ticker which then leads them to a menu from where they can select the data points they want to see.
- [x] Pull data from an external source - I created a scraper class which pulls data from www.reuters.com.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - I created a main menu to allow the user to reference information which provides a data output. I have also created a list of articles which allows the user to choose an article which will then open up in their browser.
